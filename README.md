#### Description:
This web application makes use of SQL, FLASK, Python, HTML and CSS to create a interactive platform where users can track what movies they have watched, what are the top charting movies of all time and more importantly, a social media platform where all the users in the application can interact with each other, review movies and essentially talk to each other.

I was inspired to try this idea as I love movies and am a bit of a fanatic. There are many movies that I want to watch and sometimes Iâ€™m not sure if I have watched the movie before. With this watched list, tracking of what movies has been watched becomes much more easier. Moreover, with the introduction of this mini social media platform, users have the ability to interact with like minded movie enthusiasts and could introduce or be introduced to new movies. Moreover another feature is the top charting movies. Having downloaded a database from IMDB which contain most of the movies directed, I then linked it to my web application so that the users can see the top few movies of all time.

Now I shall go into detail for each of the pages: 

To start of, we have the log in page and register page. These pages will help the user to create account and log into the application. Certain errors have been accounted for and the bugs have been fixed. Once such error is that the usernames of the the users cannot be the same. 
Secondly, we have our main page which includes a mini guide of all the instructions in the website and below is our social media channel. I decided to put it in a table form as i feel that it is easier to see and nicer looking
Next, we have our watchedlist. This included movies watched, your personal rating for that movie and the day and time you watched it.
Next, we have our top movies list. Instructions are written in the page. You are to input the number of top movies you want to see. So if you put 15, you will be given the top 15 movies of all time
Next we have connect with people. This is where you can write your posts so that it is added to the social media wall where all the users can see your comments.
Next we have add movies. This is just to add the movies to the watchedlist. 
Finally we have change password. This is to help user to change their password 

Now Ill go there my HTML and CSS choices. I thought black was a nice colour and the contrast with white is a nice shade so I decided to make black the background and the text as white. All the elements are centeralised to the center of the page making it more visually appealing too. To add on, I included some gifs in the main page so that it looks more fun and interesting. Not to mention, when the user makes certain errors, I drew inspiration from the previous assignment and added my version of apology :-)

All in all, this project had been very tedious and tiring. Having to start from the very beginning which is the ideation and slowly work up is not easy. Many good ideas due to the feasibility were thrown away due to time and experience reasons. However, I will not be deterred and I will strive to continue honing my skills to tackle newer and more difficult projects. Thank you.
